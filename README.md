# Pakrypt

## Problem Statement

## Vision

* Minimalism.
  - No list view.
  - Don't be busy.
  - Don't be too sparse.
* Multiple different storage mechanisms.

## Goals

* Have fun!
* Build skills:
  - React
  - Tailwind
* Manage different kinds of data:
  - Passwords.
  - Notes.

## Technology

* JavaScript (NodeJS)
  - TypeScript
* React
* Tailwind
* Maybe try IndexDB?
* Cryptographic Libraries
